# System-analysis-and-design-project

## Introduction
This repository is related to system analysis and design. In this project, I created a system for every bank branch to optimize the work of bank employees. By visiting the bank branch, the customer can benefit from the benefits of having an account and services in this bank by using this system by the employee, and this banking system was chosen according to my preference and with different features from today's systems. This project includes phases 0, 1, 2, and 3 and has been uploaded to Github in 4 branches.

## About phase 0
This phase includes the preparation of a project definition document (including mandatory, non-mandatory requirements, etc.), a Gantt chart of the hypothetical project development schedule (drawn with MS Project software) and the drawing of the user case prioritization matrix.
